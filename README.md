# TrafficFlow-Analyzer
A lightweight Python network traffic log analyzer. It reads sFlow/NetFlow-style CSV flow records and produces top talkers/listeners, protocol distribution, top application ports, and a sampling-aware total traffic estimate. It also exports results to Excel, generates PNG visualizations, and writes a plain-text report.
